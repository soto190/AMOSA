# AMOSA
Archive multi-objective simulated annealing (AMOSA) algorithm implemented in jmetal 5 for the heterogeneous computing scheduling problem. 
It includes an AMOSA with a fuzzy logic constroller (FLC) in Matlab 2014b. If you dont have Matlab you can delete the related 
class or comment it; or replace that part with your own FLC.

The AMOSA implementation follows the structure of jMetal 5.5.2.

This project includes diverse versions of AMOSA:
1. AMOSA
2. AMOSA with analytical tunning.
3. AMOSA with analytical tunning and fuzzy logic controller (FLC in MATLAB)
4. AMOSA with analytical tunning and stochastic.
5. Multi-objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA). 
6. Genetic MOSA.
